Battery does charge (when relay is on)
Current of 0.03 - 0.05 A (when relay is on)
Va falls out of range often, meanting power transfer is heavily chopped due to the relay
Data collection inadequate, will record data to SD in next iteration.

Improvements:
Possible PID controller for dI/dV or dP/dV which will feed into voltage PID controller.
Voltage / current PID controller causing hysterysis, may be fixed by lower bandwidth MPPT PID controller.
Characterise battery for charge measurment.
